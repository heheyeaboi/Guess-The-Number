Number Guessing Game
A simple JavaScript game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100.

How It Works
The program generates a random number between 0 and 100.

The user is prompted to guess the number.

After each guess, the program gives feedback:

"Too Low" if the guess is less than the number.

"Too High" if the guess is greater than the number.

The user keeps guessing until the correct number is found.

The total number of attempts is displayed once the user guesses correctly.
